These codes were run in an Anaconda3 environment using tensorflow GPU backend. Prolly can be run in wherever. 

Access to the data can be asked from https://ccrma.stanford.edu/damp/

The paths to the data storage need to be changed in case you want to use this code for something (why anyone actually would, I don't know :) )
